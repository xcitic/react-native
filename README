--> CryptoCurrencyApp
Cryptocurrency app developed following the tutorial from Indrek Lasn.
https://medium.com/react-native-training/bitcoin-ripple-ethereum-price-checker-with-react-native-redux-e9d076037092

This application uses react-native and axios to fetch cryptocurrency data from the API https://api.coinmarketcap.com
The data is displayed in a nicely styled application that runs on iphone and android.

Uses redux for state management.


To run application with react dev tools:
  1: Clone the repo
  2: $ npm install
